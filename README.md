To run from the command line, enter: python bot.py

This is a simple IRC bot made for my friends Twitch channel. Some simple commands are !forutne (reads a random 8ball fortune from 8ball.txt).
similarly, !fact will give you random fact, and !trailer will say a random quote from Trailer Park Boys. Only mods can use !Trailer to avoid spam.
